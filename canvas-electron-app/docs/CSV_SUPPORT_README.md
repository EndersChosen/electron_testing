# CSV Support for Communication Channel Reset

## Overview
The Communication Channel Reset feature now supports both TXT and CSV file formats for uploading email lists.

## Supported File Formats

### TXT Files (Original)
- One email address per line
- Emails can also be comma-separated on the same line
- Example:
```
user1@example.com
user2@example.com
user3@example.com
```

### CSV Files (New)
- Must contain a header row
- Must have one of the following column names (case-insensitive):
  - `path`
  - `email` 
  - `email_address`
  - `communication_channel_path`

#### Example CSV Format:
```csv
User ID,Name,Communication channel ID,Type,Path,Date of most recent bounce,Bounce reason
17390,Emerson Rexrode,17357,email,118280@augusta.k12.va.us,,
17528,Mylo Nunez,17440,email,115340@augusta.k12.va.us,,
18923,Ca'Shawn Johnson,17822,email,111569@augusta.k12.va.us,,
```

## Features

## Error Messages

Common error scenarios and their messages:

- **Missing email column**: "Could not find email column in CSV. Expected column names: path, email, email_address, communication_channel_path. Available columns: [list of actual columns]"
- **No emails found**: "No valid email addresses found in the [column name] column. Please ensure the column contains email addresses with @ symbols."
- **CSV parsing error**: "CSV parsing error: [specific error details]"

## Technical Implementation

The CSV parsing includes:
- Proper handling of quoted fields with commas
- Case-insensitive column matching
- Robust CSV parsing that handles escaped quotes
- Automatic file type detection based on extension
- Fallback to text file parsing for unknown extensions
